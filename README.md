👋 Hi, I’m Valery Hoyos

I’m a software engineer focused on building useful, production-ready web products, especially where automation, AI, and clean user experience meet. I enjoy taking ideas from vague requirements to systems that actually ship, scale, and get used.

I’ve worked across the stack, but I’m strongest when turning real business problems into reliable applications with solid backend architecture and thoughtful frontends. I care about clarity, performance, and making things easy to maintain after launch.

I’m open to remote international work, freelance projects, and collaborations where I can take ownership and deliver real outcomes.
